  At the Intersection of
  Web Accessibility & Experimental Web Design
<br><br>

  Name: Eileen Tran<br>
  Advisor: John Caserta<br><br>


  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  The most interesting website often is the least accessible to everyone. <br><br>As designers are expected to learn the basics of computer programming, are they learning about web accessibility? In every institutional setting where I have learned about computer programming or digital design, web accessibility doesn’t get its own lecture, but it is still expected from every student. According to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), web accessibility means “that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, interact and contribute to the Web.”<br>
<br>
  Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). What many people don’t realize is that  people without disabilities can benefit from web accessibility. When was the last time you forgot your earbuds when you wanted to listen to a video in a loud environment? Closed captioning doesn’t only benefit people with auditory disabilities. As we become more dependent on the Web and its uses become more diverse, it’s important to recognize that web accessibility is useful for everyone.<br>
<br>
  Web accessibility often gets a bad reputation: their interfaces are considered “sterile” or uninteresting. Accessibility standards in web design is understandably seen as a long list of restrictions. But how can we meet at the intersection of web accessibility and experimental web design? I am interested in using the web as my canvas and using conventional web technologies in an unconventional way: I create websites that have no point or they simply host a visual experience. I am also interested in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and machine learning. Are these technologies web accessible to everyone and, if not, what do those experiences look like? In my Degree Project, I hope to answer some of these questions.<br>
<br>
  <h2>Questions</h2><ol><li>How can experimental web design be accessible to people with disabilities?</li>
  <li>In what ways can accessible web design can benefit people without disabilities?</li>
  <li>What does web accessibility look like in experimental web design?</li>
  <li>What are the visual, physical, cognitive, auditory, and speech limitations experienced in experimental web design?</li>
  <li>Why is web accessibility often forgotten until the last step in web design? How can it be recognized as a priority and first step in the framework of web design?</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  “Experimental Websites”, according to awwwards.com:<br>
  Experimental websites using uncommon technologies not yet included in web standards. Websites that explore new UX patterns or experiment with voice and gestural interfaces, data visualization, predictive UX, VR, AR, MR, AI, etc.
<br><br>
  “Web Accessibility,” according to W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:<br>
  Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:
<br><br>
  -perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web<br>
  -contribute to the Web<br><br>

  Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
<ul>
  <li>auditory</li>
  <li>cognitive</li>
  <li>neurological</li>
  <li>physical</li>
  <li>speech</li>
  <li>visual</li>
</ul>
  Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:
<ul>
  <li>people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.</li>
  <li>older people with changing abilities due to ageing</li>
  <li>people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses</li>
  <li>people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio</li>
  <li>people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth</li>
</ul>
